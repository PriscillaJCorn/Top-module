This is a project to implement an adjusted Hopfield neural network with four weight matrix stimuli and multiple state variable stimuli. Berfor implementation, Before implementation, several steps should be taken. 
1. Set chaos-top as top-level.
2. Create a "clcok wizard" IP.
3. Create a testbench file.
4. Constrain the I/O.
